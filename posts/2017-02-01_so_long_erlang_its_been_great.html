    <p>Moving on from Erlang to Haskell, I look back at what I've learned in last six months, explain the reasons for the change, and say thank you.

   <h2>The last six months have been great.</h2>

<p>Six months ago, I decided to learn Erlang and to blog about my progress.  I
wanted to, over time, establish a reputation as someone knowledgeable about
Erlang so that over the time, as I dial back from full-time work, I could land
contracting gigs where I get to use Erlang instead of Java.

<p>I still remember the feeling of learning that the equals sign in Erlang is a
pattern matching operator.  This may sound crazy, but my heart still beats a
little faster at that idea&mdash;it&rsquo;s so elegant, simple, and such a radical change
from the languages I learned up until now.  Part of the attraction is that I&rsquo;ve
always loved math, and that construct matches how the equals sign works in an
equation where you are solving for an unknown variable.

<p>Over these past six months, that nugget was joined by many others:
<ul>
<li>sunny path programming</li>
<li>processes and concurrency</li>
<li>error semantics</li>
<li>baked in immutability</li>
<li>strong community</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
<li>hot code reloading</li>
</ul>

<h2>So why &ldquo;So Long&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>I tried Elm.  And I found that if my code compiled, it ran. Without error.
Every time.

<p>I think I can develop quality code faster with a strong, statically-typed
language with a great compiler (like Elm).  So I am going to try Haskell.

<h2>Thanks &hellip;</h2>

<h3>to the erlang-questions mailing list,</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lurked there for six months and learned something every day.  Very high signal to noise.
<h3>to Erlang maintainers,</h3>
<p>Responsive to pull requests on github, active (and sometimes very patient!) on the mailing list.
<h3>proctor,</h3>
<p>For Planet Erlang, it&rsquo;s a great way to learn more.
<h3>and Joe Armstrong.</h3>
<p>For his book Programming Erlang.  Great read, technically shines&mdash;short, sweet
powerful code examples throughout.
