<section>

    <p>CQRS is short for the command query responsibility separation pattern. This post traces the history of this pattern, the benefits, and discusses two common stumbling blocks: error handling and data validation.

    <h2>Command methods go in one object; query methods in another.</h2>
    <p>This is the bit Greg Young added to create CQRS.
    <p>Otherwise, this pattern is the same as Bertrand Meyer&rsquo;s Command and Query Separation principal, which
    <blockquote>
        <p>states that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other words, <em>Asking a question should not change the answer.</em>  More formally, methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.

    <h2>So what&rsquo;s the big deal?</h2>

    <p>In my experience, the database becomes the tight resource in a big system.  This CQRS pattern allows you to separate the write data model from the read data model, and this means:
    <ul>
        <li>your write model could insert into an event log table with minimal indexing, that is partioned by date, and</li>
        <li>your read model could be a set of non-normalized projections that match how data is shown in the user interface.
    </ul>
    <p>Decoupling the read and write models forces you to figure out how to feed the read side from the write side.  The most common approach is to use events; every command emits one or more events.  The read model subscribes to those events and updates their state.  (Note that this event sourcing is not required as part of CQRS.)
    <p>Using events to integrate the read and write models has some nice properties:
    <ul>
        <li>you can add a new projection at a later date and replay all events through that projection,</li>
        <li>if you have a logic error in an existing projection, you can fix it and replay all events,</li>
        <li>since the read-model projections match the user interface, queries are very fast,</li>
        <li>you can scale read model and write model independently,</li>
        <li>if you encounter a bug you know exactly what events triggered the error condition and can replay them in a testing environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to you ensure uniqueness?</h2>

    <p>In CQRS, the command processors do not access read models.  (They are split.  Completely.) This leads to a a common question: how do to validate the command data?

    <blockquote>
        <p>The problem I&rsquo;ve come to now is validation. Every post have a shortUrl, and the shortUrl should be unique, but where should I put this validation in the domain?

    <p>I have seen two different answers.
    <ol>
        <li>Accept eventual consistency and deal with this
        manually<label for="sn-option1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-option1" class="margin-toggle"/>

        It is low cost and low frequency and it is cheaper to just send an email and fix it manually.</li>
        <li>The command processor should store enough state that it can ensure business rules are
        met<label for="sn-option2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-option2" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13822693"><em>CQRS/Event Sourcing, how get consistent data to apply business rules?</em></a> (Chris Baxter, 2012)</span>
        In this specific instance, the command processor should keep a list of all current short urls.  Access to that list should be synchronized.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The second answer is from Domain Driven Design, and is my preferred approach.  I should be so blessed to have written a system so popular that the first approach is required!

    <h2>How to you handle errors?</h2>

    <p>If the data sent by a command is invalid, and a command cannot return a value, how do you report an error back to the client?
    <p>The general consensus is to raise an
    exception<label for="sn-errors" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>.
        <input type="checkbox" id="sn-errors" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="sidenote"><a href="http://cqrs.nu/Faq/testing"><em>CQRS FAQ: Testing</em></a> (Edument)</span>
    
    <p>To me, raising an exception performs the same function as returning a value, which breaks Meyer&rsquo;s rule.  Which leaves two choices:
	
	<ol>
	<li>return a value and break Meyer&rsquo;s command rule, or</li>
	<li>don&rsquo;t return a value and expose a query that retrieves the error state.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>I&rsquo;ll need to play around with this when I start building something real &hellip;
