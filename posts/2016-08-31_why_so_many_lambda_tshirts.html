    <p>Last week I was wrestling with some code when a light went off and I came up with a short and sweet solution that uses foldl.

<p>I found this functional programming approach to be much simpler than object oriented.  It allowed us to approach problems from a new direction in the sense that you only have to worry about transforming data through functions, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about inheritance and these kinds of things.  This makes it a lot easier to reason about.

   <h2>I want to group events by artist.</h2>

       <p>I&rsquo;m working on a side project that let&rsquo;s people know about local music events in our area.   It&rsquo;s working, but has a couple rough edges that I want to polish before releasing it to a wider audience.
	   
	   <p>One of those rough edges is that if one artist has multiple shows in a week, the shows are listed individually, instead of being grouped by the artist.
	   
	   <p>So, given a list of events, the task is to:
	   <ul>
	   <li>return a list that contains one element for each unique artist name, where</li>
	   <li>each element has a list of one or more dates as well as the rest of the information about that event, and</li>
	   <li>the list is ordered by first show date.</li>
	   </ul>
	 
   <h3>First attempt: sort, group, then return a list ordered by first show date.</h3>

       <p>I&rsquo;m not using SQL, so while it would be pretty easy to do this with a SQL query, that option is not available.

	   <p>And it didn&rsquo;t seem that hard.  Just

	   <ol>
	   <li>sort the event list by artist and then date</li>
	   <li>scan the list, grouping (with a map) by artist name</li>
	   <li>convert that map back to a list that looks like this: {artist, first_date, [all_dates], ticket_url, desc, &hellip;}</li>
	   <li>sort that list by the first_date field and then artist.</li>
	   </ol>

	   <p>And while that certainly would have worked, when I started implementing this approach it was taking much longer than I expected and the code was not coming easily.  So I stopped to think if there was a better way. 

	   <h2>Enter foldl, a higher order function.</h2>

        <blockquote>
            <p>A higher-order function is a function that takes other functions as arguments or returns a function as result.
            <footer>wiki.haskell.org, <cite><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Higher_order_function">Higher order function</a></cite> (retrieved August 31, 2016)</footer>
        </blockquote>

	    <p>The function foldl takes a function as an argument.  Most of the examples that are on the web are pretty simple; for example, sum the elements in a list.  Here&rsquo;s an example that does just that:<p>

        <pre class="code with-wrapping fullwidth">
<line>1> L=[1,2,3,5].</line>
<line>[1,2,3,5]</line>
<line>2> F = fun(X, Sum) -> X + Sum end.</line>
<line>#Fun&lt;erl_eval.12.52032458></line>
<line>3> lists:foldl(F, 0, L).</line>
<line>11</line>
<line>4></line>
</pre>

     <p>You apply F to the first element in the list and get the result, and then call F with the second element and that result, and so on. For example, 


        <pre class="code with-wrapping fullwidth">
<line>1> F = fun(X, Sum) -> X + Sum end.</line>
<line>#Fun&lt;erl_eval.12.52032458></line>
<line>2> F(1,0).</line>
<line>1</line>
<line>3> F(2, F(1, 0)).</line>
<line>3</line>
<line>> F(3, F(2, F(1, 0))).</line>
<line>6</line>
<line>></line>
</pre>

	<p>But you can do way more interesting things with foldl.

	<h3>You can group with foldl.</h3>

	<p>foldl is a new function to me, I haven&rsquo;t used it much in 
Java<label for="mn-java" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>.
<input type="checkbox" id="mn-java" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">
  Looks like Java 8 supports this with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/reduction.html">Stream.reduce().</a>
</span>  :)

	<p>So, I started building up from simple experiments in the Erlang interpreter.  For my task, the result of the function passed to foldl should be a list.  After some playing around with ideas in the interpreter, I came up with a function that groups:


<!-- vi: .,/<\/pre/-1 s;.*;<line>&</line>;   -->

        <pre class="code with-wrapping fullwidth">
<line>group({Artist, Val}, [{Artist, Vals}|Rest] ) -></line>
<line>	H1 = {Artist, [Val|Vals]},</line>
<line>	[H1|Rest];</line>
<line>group({Artist, Val}, Acc) -></line>
<line>	H = {Artist, [Val]},</line>
<line>	[H|Acc].</line>
</pre>

<p>Here,
<ul>
<li>the event data is the artist and another field I want to group</li>
<li>the function assumes data comes in sorted by artist and then date</li>
<li>pattern matching distinguishes when we hit a new artist in the list</li>
<li>if same artist (first function clause), we replace the current list head with an updated value</li>
<li>if new artist (second function clause), we add a new entry to the return list
</ul>

<p>Testing this,

        <pre class="code with-wrapping fullwidth">
<line>1> c(t)</line>
<line>2> t:group({a,2}, [{a,[1]}]).</line>
<line>[{a,[2,1]}]</line>
<line>3> L = [{a,1}, {a,2}, {b,1}].</line>
<line>[{a,1},{a,2},{b,1}]</line>
<line>4> lists:foldl(fun t:group/2, [], L).</line>
<line>[{b,[1]},{a,[2,1]}]</line>
</pre>



<h3>This foldl approach works with Erlang records too.</h3>


        <pre class="code with-wrapping fullwidth">
<line>group5(#event{act = Act} = E, [{Act, FirstVal, Dates}|Rest] ) -></line>
<line>        H1 = {Act, FirstVal, [E#event.date|Dates]},</line>
<line>        [H1|Rest];</line>
<line>group5(E, Acc) when is_record(E, event) -></line>
<line>        H = {E#event.act, E, [E#event.date]},</line>
<line>        [H|Acc].</line>
</pre>


<p>The interpreter test (my test code and #event record was in the module t.erl):

        <pre class="code with-wrapping fullwidth">
<line>1> c(t).</line>
<line>{ok,t}</line>
<line>2> rr(t).</line>
<line>[event]</line>
<line>3> Events = [#event{act="Big Apple", date={2018, 8, 20}, price=50.00},</line>
<line>3> #event{act="Big Apple", date={2018, 8, 21}, price=50.00},</line>
<line>3> #event{act="Red Sox", date={2018, 8, 20}, price=80.00}].</line>
<line>[#event{act = "Big Apple",date = {2018,8,20},price = 50.0},</line>
<line> #event{act = "Big Apple",date = {2018,8,21},price = 50.0},</line>
<line> #event{act = "Red Sox",date = {2018,8,20},price = 80.0}]</line>
<line>4> lists:foldl(fun t:group5/2, [], Events).</line>
<line>[{"Red Sox",</line>
<line>  #event{act = "Red Sox",date = {2018,8,20},price = 80.0},</line>
<line>  [{2018,8,20}]},</line>
<line> {"Big Apple",</line>
<line>  #event{act = "Big Apple",date = {2018,8,20},price = 50.0},</line>
<line>  [{2018,8,21},{2018,8,20}]}]</line>
<line>5></line>
</pre>



<h2>Getting back to the original blog question &hellip;</h2>


<p>I think this kind of experience is what prompts people to buy t-shirts with &lambda;&rsquo;s on them.  The difference between my traditional approach and the functional approach was like day and night.  The functional approach required far less code and was conceptually simpler (once I got my head around how foldl works).


<p>I may have to get myself one.
