X - create posts/share/l.upphtml for the post-specific template
X - cd www/posts ; ../../bin/mkws ../../posts   <-- make sure this works.
X- install apache2
- add css (copy under www as part of make, reference absolute path)
- grep title, date and tags from HTML and get rid of meta data
- copy images to www/img
 - create ./index.upphtml that:
     - lists ten most recent blog posts
     - put those on the index page 
 - add a menu (create in one share directory, then ln -s)
 - same for CSS
 - create www/img and copy images there
- grep tags from posts and generate tags page (use one page + anchors)
- add links to tag anchor in upphtml?  or do as part of rendering?
