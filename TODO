X - create posts/share/l.upphtml for the post-specific template
X - cd www/posts ; ../../bin/mkws ../../posts   <-- make sure this works.
X- install apache2
X- add css (copy under www as part of make, reference absolute path)
X- copy images to www/img
NO - change from /User/*/Sites to vhost to render generated site
X- move blog title into an H1 tag as Hakyll no longer does this for me.
X- grep title, date and tags from HTML and get rid of meta data
- Pass in page title to l.upphtml template
- convert markdown posts to uppmarkdown and update mkws to use cmark
- Add redirects to Apache vhost configuration
    archive.html -> posts
    *.html -> * ??
- create ./index.upphtml that:
     - lists ten most recent blog posts
     - put those on the index page 
- add a menu (create in one share directory, then ln -s)
- same for CSS
- create www/img and copy images there
- grep tags from posts and generate tags page (use one page + anchors)
- add links to tag anchor in upphtml?  or do as part of rendering?
