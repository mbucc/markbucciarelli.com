<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  Here is where I
keep a log of things I am learning; my current project is Haskell.

<p>When I started this site,  I had recently discovered Erlang.  So
my first posts are about that language, where I first met immutable
&ldquo;variables&rdquo; and pattern matching. That Erlang&rsquo;s
equality symbol is not assignment but pattern matching (<code>"abc"
++ S = "abcdef"</code>) is still refreshingly different from all my
previous experience with imperative languages.

<p>Then I discovered <a href="http://elm-lang.org/"
target="_blank">Elm</a>, a typed Javascript transpiler, and while
playing around with it to build a UI, I found that if the program
compiled, then the UI worked.  Everytime.  Although I have programmed
for years in Java, I had never been able to use the compiler to
such strong effect.  I was also a little tired of having to remember
the shape of data arguments in the Erlang functions as my programs
grew in size.  I learned that Elm was related to Haskell, so I
decided to give that a shot.

<p>I hope you find something useful here and don&rsquo;t hesitate
to get in touch with corrections, questions or just to say hello.

<p>Cheers!
